# Speed Ticket

This is a very simple web application which returns the punishment for a speed limit violation. The punishement is based on the german law. 

The inputs are:
- actual speed
- sign velocity
- inner or outer city

The outpus are:
- fine
- credits
- driving ban

File structure

The file structure is very simple. It consists of only three files.

index.html: Representation of the web application
style.css: Design of the web application
script.js: Script for calculating the punishment
